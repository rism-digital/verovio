                    <p>
                        Only a few lines of codes are needed to have the example above running in your webpage:
                    </p>
                    
{% highlight html %}
{% include app-code.html %} 
{% endhighlight %}
                    <p>
                        Some additional options can be passed to the constructor:
                    </p>
                    
{% highlight javascript %}
const options = {
    defaultView: 'document', // instead of 'responsive' by default
    defaultZoom: 3 // 0-7, default is 4
}
{% endhighlight %}

                    <p>
                        It is also possible to disable the responsive or the document view with <code>enableResponsive: false</code> or <code>enableDocument: false</code> respectively. Have a try directly in the following <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/lpugin/rmc18zkw/" target="_blank">JSFiddle</a>.
